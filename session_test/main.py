# --- Execute the `run_stateful_conversation` async function ---

# it means an event loop is already running, so you can directly await the function.

# the script context is synchronous. `asyncio.run()` is needed to
# create and manage an event loop to execute your async function.
# To use this method:
# 1. Comment out the `await run_stateful_conversation()` line above.
# 2. Uncomment the following block:
