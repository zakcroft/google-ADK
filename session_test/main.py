    # --- Execute the `run_stateful_conversation` async function ---
    # Choose ONE of the methods below based on your environment.

    # METHOD 1: Direct await (Default for Notebooks/Async REPLs)
    # If your environment supports top-level await (like Colab/Jupyter notebooks),
    # it means an event loop is already running, so you can directly await the function.
    # print("Attempting execution using 'await' (default for notebooks)...")
    # await run_stateful_conversation()

    # METHOD 2: asyncio.run (For Standard Python Scripts [.py])
    # If running this code as a standard Python script from your terminal,
    # the script context is synchronous. `asyncio.run()` is needed to
    # create and manage an event loop to execute your async function.
    # To use this method:
    # 1. Comment out the `await run_stateful_conversation()` line above.
    # 2. Uncomment the following block:


    # if __name__ == "__main__": # Ensures this runs only when script is executed directly
    #     print("Executing using 'asyncio.run()' (for standard Python scripts)...")
    #     try:
    #         # This creates an event loop, runs your async function, and closes the loop.
    #         asyncio.run(run_stateful_conversation())
    #
    #

    #     # This block runs after either execution method completes.
